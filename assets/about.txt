Text: Hi, I'm Urim Choi, a self-taught front-end developer based in Brooklyn, NY. 

My journey began with HTML/CSS many years ago and have learned the full stack by jumping head first into projects I had no idea how to accomplish. Through my successes and failures, I've been able to hone in my front end development chops while expanding my horizons into UI/UX design and back-end development. I'm currently exploring node.js, Python, and Swift. I make it a point to go beyond my comfort zones so that I can continually improve the beauty of my code and my ability to solve practical real-world problems that mean something.
